Sharing reports is a common requirement in data science; analyses and model evaluations often need to be 
made available to peer reviewers, business stakeholders, and internal compliance and validation functions - among others.
There are some excellent frameworks, such as [Dash][dash] and [Bokeh][bokeh], for creating sophisticated interactive
applications but when it comes to producing a self contained static document there is a surprising lack of
satisfying alternatives.

This is the motivation behind *esparto*: a lightweight framework for producing well 
formatted pages with minimal effort. I like to think of it as a middle-ground between a Jupyter Notebook and a fully
featured interactive dashboard. 

Esparto provides a streamlined API that lets users define their page in terms of sections, rows, and columns; 
and an intelligent wrapping system that automatically converts Python objects into content. 
The grid system and components are borrowed from [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to ensure documents adapt to viewing devices
with a clean and consistent style. At publishing time, the completed document is passed to [Jinja2][jinja2] and fed 
into an HTML template with all style details and dependencies captured inline. There is also the option to save
the page as a PDF file through integration with [Weasyprint][weasyprint].

Esparto supports content rendering within Jupyter Notebooks, allowing users to interactively and iteratively build 
documents without disrupting their workflow.

Please check out the [documentation][documentation] and [GitHub repo][github] if you'd like to learn more.
