Sharing reports is a common problem in data science, especially when analyses and model evaluations need to be 
distributed among non technical audiences. Frameworks such as [Dash][dash] and [Bokeh][bokeh] are excellent options 
when it comes to producing sophisticated, interactive applications, however they can prove to be overly complex and 
awkward when the desired output is a simple shareable document.

This is the motivation behind *esparto*: a lightweight framework that aims to do nothing more than produce well 
formatted pages with minimal effort. There are plans to develop a suite of model evaluation templates with esparto as 
a backend, but for now it seems worth sharing as a potential middleground between Jupyter Notebooks and some of the 
more full featured yet complicated solutions.

The library provides a streamlined API that lets users define their page in terms of sections, rows, and columns; 
and an intelligent wrapping system that automatically converts Python objects into content.

We use the grid system and components from [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to ensure documents adapt to the viewing device and 
appear immediately familiar and accessible. No knowledge of Bootstrap or web development is required to use the library, 
however, as these details are conveniently abstracted.

At publishing time, the completed document is passed to [Jinja2][jinja2] and fed into an HTML template with all style 
details and dependencies captured inline.

Esparto supports content rendering within Jupyter Notebooks, allowing users to interactively and iteratively build 
documents without disrupting their workflow.
